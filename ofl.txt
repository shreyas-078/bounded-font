SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007  
----------------------------------------------------  

PREAMBLE  
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide  
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation  
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and  
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership  
with others.  

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified, and  
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The  
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,  
redistributed, and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved  
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,  
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The  
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply  
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
